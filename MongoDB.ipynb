In contrast, NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema-less or flexible in structure, and use various data models like key-value, document, column-family, or graph; they prioritize horizontal scaling, high performance for large distributed datasets, and often follow BASE principles, making them ideal for unstructured or rapidly changing data."

It supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it ideal for large-scale, distributed systems. MongoDB’s rich query language, built-in indexing, and aggregation framework enable powerful data retrieval and analytics, while its high availability is ensured by replica sets. Its ability to integrate easily with modern programming languages, cloud services, and microservices architectures makes it a strong fit for applications that require fast development, scalability, and adaptability such as real-time analytics, IoT platforms, and content management systems."
